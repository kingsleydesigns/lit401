    <div>
        <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
        <p>The advent of emerging technologies has revolutionized project management practices, 
            significantly impacting customer satisfaction. This study evaluates the effect of emerging technologies on customer satisfaction in project management practices.
        </p>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
          The advent of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced analytics, has significantly transformed project management practices. 
          These innovations aim to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making processes. However, their direct impact on customer satisfaction within project management contexts remains underexplored. 
          This study seeks to evaluate how the integration of these technologies influences customer satisfaction in project management.
        <h4>Research Objectives</h4>
        <p id="research">
