        <h4>LITERATURE REVIEW</h4>
        <p>
          Emerging technologies are increasingly integrated into project management to improve efficiency and decision-making. For instance, AI and ML facilitate predictive analytics, enabling proactive risk management and resource allocation. Big Data Analytics provides real-time insights, enhancing project monitoring and control. These advancements can lead to improved project performance and customer satisfaction. 
          <br>However, the adoption of these technologies also presents challenges. Integrating new tools with existing systems can be complex and costly, requiring careful planning and resource allocation. Additionally, managing cybersecurity risks has become a critical concern, as increased reliance on digital platforms exposes projects to potential data breaches and cyber threats. 
          <br>Despite these challenges, the digital era offers numerous opportunities for enhancing project management practices. Leveraging AI and data analytics can lead to more accurate project forecasting and risk management, improving overall project outcomes. Digital tools also enable greater flexibility and agility in project execution, allowing organizations to respond more quickly to changes and challenges. 
        </p>
        <h4>METHODOLOGY</h4>
        <p>
          A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews with project managers and clients across various industries. 
          Data will be analyzed to identify correlations between technology adoption and customer satisfaction levels.
        </p>
        <h4>EXPECTED OUTCOMES</h4>
        <p>
          The study anticipates uncovering specific technologies that significantly enhance customer satisfaction and providing recommendations for their effective implementation in project management practices.
